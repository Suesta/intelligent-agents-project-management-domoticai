# intelligent-agents-project-management-domoticai

Case study for **DomoticAI**: project definition across PM frameworks, **Cynefin** & **Wysocki** classification, **CRISP-DM** lifecycle mapping, and **Agile/Scrum** sprint design.

## Overview

This repository contains a written deliverable that analyzes the DomoticAI project (an intelligent agent for home/building automation) from a **data/analytics project perspective**:

- Formal project definition using common **project management frameworks**
- Complexity and project-type characterization (Cynefin + Wysocki)
- End-to-end **CRISP-DM** mapping for an intelligent-agent / data-driven system
- Practical **Scrum** planning: sprint inputs/outputs, roles, artifacts, and events

## What You’ll Find in the Report

### 1) Project definition across PM frameworks
- How the DomoticAI work can be framed as a project (temporary effort, unique outcome, constraints)
- Business/value orientation and project control constraints

### 2) Cynefin + Wysocki classification
- Positioning DomoticAI in the Cynefin domains based on uncertainty and cause–effect clarity  
- Classifying the project using Wysocki’s objective/solution clarity matrix and deriving implications

### 3) CRISP-DM applied to DomoticAI
- Business Understanding → deployment planning tailored to an intelligent agent
- Data-centric considerations: sensor/event streams, quality checks, integration of external sources
- Modeling/evaluation choices aligned with measurable value (energy efficiency + comfort)

### 4) Agile/Scrum delivery design
- Why Agile fits a data-driven product with evolving requirements and integration constraints
- One sprint described end-to-end (explicit inputs, outputs, and acceptance feedback loop)
- Roles, artifacts, and events contextualized to a multidisciplinary DS/engineering setup
